# Expected conformance test failures for protovalidate-ruby
#
# This file lists test cases that are known to fail.
# As the implementation matures, this list should be reduced.
#
# Format: List of test case paths that are expected to fail
# Example:
#   - standard_rules/well_known_types/duration
#   - custom_rules/cel_expression

# No expected failures yet - add as needed during conformance testing
